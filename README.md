# Premia Mobile
### iOS User Client for Premia

I recently got the idea to take Premia and convert it from a monolithic application into a microservices application. 
This will make it possible for me to have multiple clients, so this iOS app will be one of those clients.
Right now I'm just learning my way around Swift, but it shouldn't be too hard to get this thing API ready. 
I've already found a library I think I will be using for the charts, which is ![Charts](https://github.com/danielgindi/Charts/).

Otherwise, I couldn't think of anything technical or professional to put in the readme yet so I just figured I'd write a little paragraph

*Built with XCode 13*
